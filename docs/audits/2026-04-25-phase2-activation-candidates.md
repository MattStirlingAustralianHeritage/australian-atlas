# Phase 2 Activation Candidates — Polygon-Based Analysis

**Date:** 2026-04-25 (revised)
**Supersedes:** original clustering-based version (replaced after Matt flagged Mornington Peninsula showing as "2 listings" when the map clearly showed dozens).
**Method:** For each candidate region, fetched the proposed polygon (ABS TR or OSM LGA aggregate) and ran point-in-polygon against all 6,509 rows of the Phase 2 dry-run CSV. Records three counts per candidate:

1. **NULL inside polygon** — listings currently projected to quarantine that would resolve to this region if activated. This is the real **quarantine rescue** figure.
2. **Reassign from live** — listings currently assigned to a broader live region (e.g. Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide) that would move to this more specific region under smallest-polygon-wins. This is the **editorial precision upgrade** figure.
3. **Total inside polygon** — sanity check (= NULL + reassigns). Flags cases where a candidate overlaps an already-live region.

**Thresholds:** 20 NULL-rescue for standard activation; 15 for brand-anchor destinations (Margaret River, Barossa Valley, McLaren Vale, Yarra Valley, Great Ocean Road) per the original task spec. Reassign count is *not* part of the threshold but is reported separately as editorial context.

**Resilience:** API fetches had 3-retry exponential backoff (2s, 5s, 15s). 6 of 40 initial Nominatim queries needed variant names (e.g. "Southern Downs Regional Council" → "Southern Downs") — all resolved on retry. All 40 candidates successfully evaluated; zero had to be skipped.

## TL;DR

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Candidates evaluated | **40 / 40** |
| Candidates passing NULL threshold | **34** |
| Candidates failing NULL threshold | 6 |
| Sum of NULL-listings rescued if all 34 activated | **~2,690** (of 3,425 projected-NULL) |
| Sum of reassign-from-live if all 34 activated | ~85 (mostly McLaren Vale/82 from Adelaide) |
| Projected remaining quarantine after activation | **~735** |
| Editorial precision regions (fail NULL threshold but high reassign) | 3 — Mornington, Yarra Valley, Blue Mountains (366 combined reassigns) |

**Previous-count corrections.** The clustering approach undercounted brand-anchor regions because listings on e.g. Mornington Peninsula already match the Greater Melbourne polygon and so didn't appear in the NULL population at all. Polygon-based counts reveal the true picture:

| Region | Previous (cluster) | NULL in polygon | Total in polygon | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mornington Peninsula | 2 | 0 | **145** | All currently in Melbourne |
| Yarra Valley | 5 | 0 | **147** | All currently in Melbourne |
| Blue Mountains | 19 | 14 | 88 | 74 currently in Sydney |

These are editorial precision plays (listings labelled with too-broad a region), not quarantine reducers. They don't meet the NULL threshold but are noted for Matt's call.

## Passing NULL threshold (34 candidates) — in rank order

Copy of rows 1–34 from the master table. Together these rescue **~2,690 listings from quarantine** plus ~85 additional reassignments (mostly McLaren Vale pulling 82 listings from broad Adelaide polygon into the Fleurieu precisely).

## Failing NULL threshold (6 candidates) — individual notes

### `alice-springs-red-centre` — 16 NULL / 16 total / fails 20

Polygon = Alice Springs township + MacDonnell Regional Council LGA (combined). Earlier cluster count was 21 at Alice Springs centroid; polygon-based count is 16. Difference is listings in Central Desert Regional Council (north of Alice) or Petermann Shire (Uluru area) which aren't in the MacDonnell polygon. To capture the full "Red Centre" tourism concept, the polygon would need Alice Springs + MacDonnell + Central Desert + Petermann = a much larger aggregate. **Recommended follow-up:** expand the aggregate. If still ≤20 after expansion, accept and defer — NT tourism inventory is genuinely thin.

### `blue-mountains` — 14 NULL / 88 total / 74 reassign from Sydney / fails 20

Blue Mountains sits entirely within the Greater Sydney OSM `place=city` polygon (rel 5750005). So 74 of 88 Blue Mountains listings already resolve to `sydney`. Only 14 fall into the NULL population, and those 14 are below threshold. However, activating Blue Mountains would reassign 74 Sydney-labelled listings to a more specific, editorially correct region (Katoomba, Leura, Blackheath, Megalong Valley, Bilpin). Editorial precision upgrade — **Matt's call**: worth the 14-NULL sub-threshold for 74 reassignments, or defer?

### `kangaroo-island` — 12 NULL / 12 total / fails 20

Below threshold. Genuinely thin inventory; no reassignment contribution. Kangaroo Island is a single-island geography with limited small-batch venues. Defer.

### `grampians` — 7 NULL / 7 total / fails 20

Surprising — earlier box probe showed 19 listings. The issue: ABS TR `2R050` is **Western Grampians** only, covering the Hamilton/Dunkeld/Coleraine area. But the Grampians tourism region includes Halls Gap, Pomonal, Ararat — in Northern Grampians Shire (LGA), which is a separate council outside the Western Grampians TR. ABS TR has no standalone "Grampians" tourism region that covers the whole iconic Grampians National Park area.

**Recommended follow-up:** build an OSM LGA aggregate of Northern Grampians Shire + Southern Grampians Shire + Ararat Rural City. This should capture the full ~19 listings of the earlier box probe and cross the 20 threshold.

### `mornington-peninsula` — 0 NULL / 145 total / 145 reassign from Melbourne / fails 15

**Key correction.** Original cluster count of "2" was wrong because all Mornington Peninsula listings already match the broad Greater Melbourne polygon, so they never entered the NULL population. Polygon-based analysis: 145 listings sit inside ABS TR `2R070` Peninsula, all currently assigned to `melbourne`. Activating Mornington would reassign all 145 to the precise peninsula region under smallest-polygon-wins — editorial precision upgrade from "Greater Melbourne" to "Mornington Peninsula" for 145 listings.

**Brand-anchor caveat:** the task's NULL threshold is "no exceptions below 15." Strictly applied, Mornington fails. But the editorial argument here is that the inventory isn't missing — it's mislabelled. Matt's call.

### `yarra-valley` — 0 NULL / 147 total / 147 reassign from Melbourne / fails 15

Same story as Mornington. 147 listings inside ABS TR `2R220` Yarra Valley & Dandenong Ranges, all currently in `melbourne`. 147 reassignments, 0 quarantine rescue. Brand-anchor precision upgrade.

## Editorial precision upgrades (low NULL, high reassign)

Regions where activation would not rescue listings from quarantine but would move a material number from broader live regions to more specific ones. Listed for Matt's decision on whether editorial precision justifies activation under a relaxed threshold:

| Region | NULL | Reassign | Current "home" | Brand anchor? |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Yarra Valley | 0 | 147 | Melbourne | **yes** |
| Mornington Peninsula | 0 | 145 | Melbourne | **yes** |
| Blue Mountains | 14 | 74 | Sydney | no |
| **Total** | 14 | **366** | — | — |

If Matt greenlights the three above in addition to the 34 passing candidates:
- Total rescue: ~2,690 + 14 = ~2,704 (quarantine impact same order)
- Total reassign: ~85 + 366 = ~451 (editorial precision upgrade)
- Remaining quarantine: ~720

## Ambiguities resolved by polygon counts

Several ambiguities in the original report are easier to resolve with concrete polygon-based numbers:

### Ambiguity 1 (Central Victoria slicing) — resolved: three separate activations

Polygon-based counts for the three sub-regions:
- `bendigo` (ABS TR 2R060 Bendigo Loddon): **118 NULL**
- `daylesford` (ABS TR 2R160 Spa Country): **61 NULL**
- `macedon-ranges` (ABS TR 2R150 Macedon): **38 NULL**

All three individually pass the 20 threshold. Combined = 217 listings. Three separate activations is both editorially precise and threshold-valid.

### Ambiguity 2 (Sunshine Coast coast vs hinterland) — resolved: two separate regions

- `sunshine-coast` (ABS TR 3R030, broader): **189 NULL**
- `sunshine-coast-hinterland` (OSM Sunshine Coast LGA rel 11675192, narrower): **148 NULL**

The ABS TR 3R030 *encloses* the LGA polygon (rings within rings — sunshine-coast covers Noosa/Gympie hinterland too). If both activated with smallest-area-wins, hinterland listings resolve to hinterland polygon while coastal non-hinterland listings (Fraser Coast bits) resolve to broader `sunshine-coast`. Net rescue = 189 regardless. Activating both is worth it for editorial precision nesting.

### Ambiguity 3 (Illawarra/SH/Shoalhaven) — resolved: three separate activations

- `wollongong` (OSM Wollongong+Shellharbour): **80 NULL**
- `southern-highlands` (OSM Wingecarribee): **32 NULL**
- `shoalhaven` (OSM Shoalhaven): **25 NULL** (note: `south-coast-nsw` also activated as Kiama+Shoalhaven = 36 NULL, overlaps)

All three pass individually. But **`south-coast-nsw` (36) and `shoalhaven` (25) substantially overlap** — Shoalhaven City Council is in both polygons. Need to pick one of the two, not both. Recommendation: use `south-coast-nsw` (36 NULL, broader = Kiama + Shoalhaven together) and deprecate the standalone `shoalhaven` draft.

### Ambiguity 5 (Granite Belt inside Darling Downs) — resolved: nest both

- `toowoomba-darling-downs` (ABS TR 3R060): **124 NULL** — covers both DD and Granite Belt via one TR
- `granite-belt` (OSM Southern Downs): **36 NULL** — nested inside TDD

TDD covers both; Granite Belt narrower. Activating both with smallest-area-wins: Stanthorpe area resolves to `granite-belt`, Toowoomba area resolves to `toowoomba-darling-downs`. Net rescue = 124 (already counts Granite Belt). Activating Granite Belt separately adds **editorial precision** (Stanthorpe wine region distinct) at zero rescue cost.

### Ambiguity 6 (McLaren Vale = Fleurieu) — resolved: accept compression

- `mclaren-vale` (ABS TR 4R030 Fleurieu Peninsula): **59 NULL + 82 reassign from Adelaide = 141 total**

The ABS TR covers the full Fleurieu Peninsula (Willunga, McLaren Vale, Victor Harbor, Normanville). Activating as `mclaren-vale` is an editorial compression — the slug is the brand name, polygon is the broader Fleurieu. The 82 Adelaide-reassigns are peninsula listings currently lumped into broad Adelaide; they'd move to McLaren Vale for precision.

### Ambiguity 7 (Canberra wine region) — resolved: INSERT new row

- `canberra-wine` (OSM Yass Valley Council): **32 NULL**

32 wine listings in Yass Valley LGA (Murrumbateman, Gundaroo, Lake George) are currently NULL because they sit outside the ACT-only Canberra District live polygon. Activating as a new `canberra-wine` slug is clean (32 rescue, 0 reassign — doesn't touch the existing Canberra District polygon). The alternative (expanding Canberra District polygon to include Yass Valley) would work too but blurs ACT governance boundary with NSW editorial region.

### Ambiguity 4 (Geelong-Bellarine combined/split) — resolved: activate both

- `bellarine-peninsula` (ABS TR 2R140, covers both): **71 NULL**
- `geelong-city` (OSM City of Greater Geelong LGA): **60 NULL**

City of Greater Geelong LGA is *inside* the ABS TR 2R140 polygon — the TR covers both Geelong city and the Bellarine Peninsula. Under smallest-polygon-wins: listings inside City of Greater Geelong resolve to `geelong-city`, listings on the Bellarine Peninsula proper resolve to `bellarine-peninsula`. Net rescue = 71 (the TR count; geelong-city is a subset). Activating both for editorial precision is zero-cost.

## Polygon scope issues flagged for rework

Two polygons surfaced as undersized for their editorial region name. Not activation blockers but worth recording for the follow-up:

1. **`grampians`** using ABS TR `2R050` Western Grampians captures only 7 listings. Real Grampians tourism area needs Northern Grampians Shire + Southern Grampians Shire + Ararat Rural City aggregated. Under-reach by ~12 listings.
2. **`alice-springs-red-centre`** using Alice Springs Town Council + MacDonnell Regional Council captures 16 listings. Full Red Centre concept needs MacDonnell + Central Desert Regional Council + Petermann Shire. Under-reach by ~5 listings — but likely still under 20 even after expansion.

## Projected outcome if all 34 passing candidates activated

**Current state (post-14-region):** 3,425 NULL / 6,509 eligible = 52.6% quarantine rate.

**Target state (post-48-region):** ~735 NULL / 6,509 eligible = ~11% quarantine rate.

| Component | Listings |
|---|---:|
| Current NULL | 3,425 |
| Rescued by 34 passing candidates | -2,690 |
| Remaining NULL | **~735** |

The remaining ~735 NULL population is genuinely diffuse — scattered regional and remote listings that don't fall inside any practical 50+ km² polygon at editorial threshold. Correct outcome for these is quarantine + admin override, not activation.

## Deliverables needed from Matt before Phase B

1. **Ambiguity resolutions** — five concrete decisions in the Ambiguities section above. Most resolve cleanly given the real numbers:
   - Central Victoria: activate three separate regions (bendigo, daylesford, macedon-ranges). ✓ straightforward
   - Sunshine Coast: activate both broader TR + hinterland OSM. ✓ straightforward
   - Illawarra triangle: wollongong + southern-highlands + south-coast-nsw (drop standalone shoalhaven due to overlap).
   - Granite Belt: nest under Darling Downs for editorial precision. ✓
   - McLaren Vale = Fleurieu: accept compression. ✓
   - Canberra wine: INSERT new row. ✓

2. **Editorial precision decisions** — does Matt activate the 3 below-NULL-threshold regions with high reassign counts (Mornington 145, Yarra Valley 147, Blue Mountains 74)?

3. **Polygon scope rework** — green-light to re-source `grampians` with broader LGA aggregate, and `alice-springs-red-centre` with more desert LGAs, before or instead of accepting the current polygons?

4. **Below-threshold genuinely-thin candidates** (Alice Springs 16, Kangaroo Island 12, Grampians 7 pre-rework) — defer to future quarterly review when inventory grows, or accept permanent quarantine for those venues?

Once Matt resolves the above, Phase B activation script runs in the pattern of `activate-regions-osm-lga.mjs`, adapted to handle ABS TR candidates. Single batch commit activates all green-lit regions with polygons + updated sourcing report.

## Polygon rework results (2026-04-25, later same day)

Re-sourced the two under-scoped polygons flagged in the previous section. All LGA lookups used 3-retry exponential backoff with variant name fallback.

### Grampians — **7 → 32 NULL (now passes threshold)**

|---|---|
| New source | OSM LGA aggregate |
| Components | Northern Grampians Shire (rel 3348880) + Southern Grampians Shire (rel 3349959) + Rural City of Ararat (rel 3347614) |
| Polygon | 3 rings, bbox 141.43–143.51°E / -37.97 to -36.41°S |
| NULL inside | **32** |
| Total inside | 32 |
| Reassign from live | 0 |
| Threshold (20 standard) | **PASS** |

The three VIC LGAs resolved cleanly on first-variant Nominatim queries. Aggregate bbox captures the full Grampians tourism region — Hamilton and Dunkeld in the south (Southern Grampians), Halls Gap and Pomonal in the centre (Northern Grampians), Ararat in the east (Ararat Rural City).

**Delta vs. ABS TR `2R050`:** 7 → 32 NULL (+25). The TR was Western-Grampians-LGA-only and excluded the Halls Gap + Ararat portions of the tourism region. LGA aggregate is the correct source for `grampians`.

### Alice Springs & Red Centre — **16 → 18 NULL (still fails threshold)**

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| New source | OSM LGA aggregate |
| Components | Alice Springs (rel 11716659) + MacDonnell (rel 11716646) + Central Desert Region (rel 8878328) + Petermann (rel 11716684) |
| Polygon | 4 rings, bbox 129.00–138.00°E / -26.00 to -17.95°S |
| NULL inside | **18** |
| Total inside | 18 |
| Reassign from live | 0 |
| Threshold (20 standard) | **FAIL** |

All four NT LGAs resolved cleanly. Adding Central Desert and Petermann to the earlier two-LGA aggregate added only 2 more NULL listings, not the meaningful bump hoped for.

**Delta vs. two-LGA aggregate:** 16 → 18 NULL (+2). The remaining ~5 NT NULL listings (total network-wide NT NULLs were ~21 in the earlier cluster probe) are either outside the four-LGA polygon footprint or are listings that already matched a live region (unlikely for NT given Darwin & Top End and Canberra District are the only NT/ACT polygons and neither covers central NT).

**Scope note:** the aggregate now extends north to -17.95°S, approaching Tennant Creek territory via Central Desert Regional Council. Arguably over-reach for an editorial "Red Centre" region. If Matt prefers tighter scope, dropping Central Desert and keeping Alice + MacDonnell + Petermann would give bbox roughly -26 to -22°S, still capturing Uluru-Kata Tjuta and Kings Canyon but excluding the Tennant Creek corridor. That version gave 18 − Central-Desert-specific hits, not separately computed here.

**Conclusion:** NT inventory is genuinely thin outside Darwin & Top End and Alice Springs proper. Even with the broadest sensible Red Centre polygon, the 20-listing threshold can't be met. Matt's options:

1. Accept fail — defer `alice-springs-red-centre` activation until inventory grows.
2. Override threshold — activate as a "below-threshold editorial region" on the strength of Alice Springs being a brand destination (not on the formal brand list, but arguably iconic enough). 18 listings do represent the full meaningful NT central-region inventory.
3. Keep the two-LGA polygon (Alice + MacDonnell) — it captures 16 of the 18 at a tighter scope.

## Updated projected outcome

If Grampians now passes and gets activated:
- Current state: 3,425 NULL
- 34 original passing + Grampians = 35 candidates at 2,722 rescue
- Remaining quarantine: ~703 (vs ~735 previously projected)

If Matt also overrides threshold for Alice Springs + the three precision-upgrade candidates (Mornington 0, Yarra 0, Blue Mountains 14):
- Rescue = 2,722 + 0 + 0 + 14 + 18 = 2,754
- Reassignment = 145 + 147 + 74 = 366
- Remaining quarantine: ~671
